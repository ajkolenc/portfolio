		<p>
			As a developer working for <a href="http://www.primalscreen.com/">Primal Screen</a>, I created two games to be included with an upcoming PBS streaming dongle. These games are targeted toward children ages 6-10, and were built in Unity.

		<h2>Rail Riders</h2>

		<p>
			Rail Riders is an I-Spy game where you follow a train and try to spot stickers placed in the background, collecting them as you go along. You pass through fun (and sometimes impossible) environments such as an Amusement Park, a Jungle, Underwater, and even Outer Space.

		<h2>Sound Box</h2>

		<p>
			Sound Box lets you create your own melodies and beats in a fun and easy interface. Choose between diverse groups of sounds such as Classical, Percussion, or Animals.

		<h2>Contribution</h2>
		<p>
			As the only programmer on the team, I was responsible for all functionality in the games. Additionally, I
			<ul>
				<li>Worked with artists to import and integrate art assets</li>
				<li>Maintained packed textures to allow for efficient sprite rendering</li>
				<li>Worked with the sound designer to design appropriate sounds for both games</li>
				<li>Provided all in-engine animations and particle effects</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Rail Riders</strong> was a particular challenge, as it leaned heavily on procedural generation. Each environment is programmatically placed as you encounter it, and historical data is saved such that you can go backward and see the same scenery you passed before. To allow for authored influence on the generation, I developed a UI to create weighted graphs that are then traversed to place the elements on each parallax layer.
