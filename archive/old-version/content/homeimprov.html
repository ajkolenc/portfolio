			Originally created in a Global Game Jam, Home Improvisation became an internet sensation: I joined the Stork Burnt Down to develop the prototype into a full game.
		</p>
		<p>
			After a year in Early Access, we released the game in July 2016 to success on <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/357670/\">Steam</a>. The game included full support for the HTC Vive at launch, and later became a launch title for the Oculus Touch controllers.

		<h2>Contribution</h2>
		<p>
			As Lead Developer, I was responsible for the large majority of the code in the game. This included the development of: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All major gameplay systems</li>
			<li>Seamless networked multiplayer functionality</li>
			<li>A robust serialization system for game save data</li>
			<li>A flexible user-generated content system for Steam Workshop</li>
			<li>Controls for many different devices, including mouse, keyboard, gamepad, HTC Vive, and Oculus Rift
			<li>Thorough integration of the Steam and Oculus Rift platform APIs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			As the game was developed with a small team of 3, I also contributed to other aspects of the project. This included composing the title piece of the soundtrack, creating the user interfaces, finding and integrating sound effects, and countless other tasks over the development cycle.
