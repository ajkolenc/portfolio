			Zentacle is a procedural art tool that allows for the flexible creation of spirals. Through the manipulation of a few parameters, you can create a large variety of interesting and beautiful patterns.
		</p>
		<p>
			I designed and created Zentacle to explore the possibilities of a simulation-driven approach to spiral creation. Each spoke of the spiral is an independent "particle" with its own velocities and accelerations; this allows (and in fact necessitates) the creation process to be animated, which gives user another axis on which to appreciate their creation.
		</p>
		<h2>User Interface</h2>
		<p>
			Another impetus behind Zentacle is to allow the creation of spirals in an approachable and user-friendly way. The interface consumed the vast majority of the development time, and involved several iterations and playtests before it reached its current state. One important consideration in this process was determining which parameters to expose to the users; my target was to have as few as possible, while still retaining the expressive capabilities of the application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The interface involved custom implementations of several standard UI features, including:
			<ul>
				<li>An industry-standard color picker</li>
				<li>A input-focus system for UI elements</li>
				<li>A flexible dropdown system, with sub-menus</li>
				<li>Copy/paste functionality</li>
			</ul>
			Additionally, the project involved interfacing with native UI functionality for both Web and Windows.
