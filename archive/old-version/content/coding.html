		<p>
			I have been working in programming professionally since 2015, mainly working in C# (for game development) and HTML / CSS / JavaScript (for web and game development).
		</p>
		<h2>Object-Oriented</h2>
		<p>
			I was taught programming in Java and have continued using object-oriented languages over the course of my career. I use C# extensively in the context of the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> game engine, including building back-end infrastructure, user interface programming, gameplay scripting, and many other functionality.
		</p>

		<h2>Web Development</h2>
		<p>
			My work as a web developer spans from small, personal websites, to industry-grade technologies and frameworks, to web/mobile HTML5 games. I have worked professionally in the field several times as a contractor. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Working under Primal Screen, I added core functionality and styling to their <a href="http://www.primalscreen.com/">company website</a> (which uses the Laravel PHP framework). I also worked on numerous games using <a href="http://springroll.io">SpringRoll</a>, which is based on the EaselJS wrapper for HTML5 canvas. I used EaselJS again when developing games for Cartoon Network's CN Anything mobile app.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have maintained competency in core web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) by creating my portfolio websites from scratch (including this website). This has allowed my knowledge of web standards to stay current and expand over time, as I refresh my portfolio once a year at minimum.
		</p>

		<h2>Technologies/Platforms</h2>
		<p>
			Through my game development career I have worked with numerous different technologies and platforms, <a href="http://www.homeimprovisation.com/">Home Improvisation</a> being a major example of many of these technologies. 			
		</p>

		<h3>Virtual Reality</h3>

		</div>
		<p>
			I have extensive experience with the <strong>Oculus Rift</strong> and <strong>HTC Vive</strong>, both of which I supported for Home Improvisation. This included working directly the the input and rendering APIs for both platforms, and creating a layer of abstraction to enable interchanging the systems with minimal code duplication. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I started working in VR with the original Oculus Rift development kit, and participated in the 2013 VR Jam (see video). This familiarity with the affordances of VR as a medium allowed me to make a quality VR port of Home Improvisation, and has continued to shape my perspective as I continue making games in VR.
		</p>

		<h3>Steam / Oculus Platforms</h3>
		<p>
			Home Improvisation also has extensive integration with Oculus and Steam as content platforms. This includes:
			<ul>
				<li>Managing cloud-stored save data</li>
				<li>Accessing user data for online matchmaking</li>
				<li>Facilitating user-generated content</li>
				<li>Implenting entitlement checks</li>
			</ul>
