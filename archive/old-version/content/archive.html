					Epic Lutes puts you in the shoes of a lute-maker, creating custom instruments for your clients. Choose between a number of hulls and attachments, and add strings to make your instrument play the notes your clients requested.
				</p>
				<p>
					Born in the 2016 Global Game Jam, Epic Lutes was created by a team of five in 48 hours. After some additional polish work, the game was accepted into the IndieCade E3 showcase. I worked as one of two developers on the team, concentrating on project structure, UI, and sound mechanics.

					Pedestria puts you in control of an abstract creature capable of flight. An unidentified entity is unknowingly spreading corruption across your planet: you must find and stop it before the entire planet is engulfed.
				</p>
				<p>
					I developed Pedestria along with Richard Boeser of Sparpweed as a prototype. Originally conceived for the Oculus Rift, the concept eventually morphed into a flight simulator with unique controls (each wing is controlled by a joystick).

					Mermaids is a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) where players are mermaids. Bucking genre trends, Mermaids doesn't have combat; instead, players are encouraged to explore the environment and maintain a healthy ecosystem by cooperating with each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					Mermaids was developed as a research project in the Emergent Game Group over the course of many years. I served as Lead Designer for Mermaids for three semesters, managing a team ranging from 10-15 people of various experience levels while contributing features myself. I initially joined the project as a composer, but later expanded my role to include programming and design.

					Sunset is a small, procedural game created as part of an 10-hour game jam. Conceived for mobile platforms, Sunset puts the user in an endless cycle of days.</p>

				<p>
					At night, seeds fall from the sky and can be sped to the ground. In the morning, trees grow from the seeds and bear fruit over the day, which can be collected. At sunset, the trees die and the cycle begins anew. Each fruit you pick becomes a star in the sky at night.

				<p>
					Black Oak Manor is haunted, and it's up to a team of investigators to find the monster inhabiting the house and destroy it. Up to four players on one screen work together to defeat another player, who plays on a different screen. The game was originally developed as a prototype in the <a href="http://vgdev.org/">Georgia Tech VGDev</a> club, and was expanded afterwards in a team of 4.
				</p>
				<p>
					I created the UI functionality and design for the game, as well as composing the score.

					Trigger Paradox was created for the 2014 Global Game Jam in a team of 6, where it was awarded 2<sup>nd</sup> place. The theme was "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."
				</p>
				<p>
					The game places you on the back of your own arm, and you must find your way off. You can do this by using your trusty gravity gun to remove obstacles and solve puzzles. Occasionally, you may need to twist your arm to jostle some of the rubbish out of place.
